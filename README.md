I used this tutorial for setting up flutter. It was pretty confusing downloading this, not sure if I
am still missing anything but I will edit this README as I continue with this project.

HOW TO RUN:
I ran this project by going into the terminal and ran the command "flutter run" 
the project is able to compile and a separate window pops up.
